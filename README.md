#### libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn
#### Motivations: In this study I will analyze customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer types, using Starbucks simulated rewards data"
#### Summary of the results:
> Women are in general more willing to spend more and also complete an offer.<br>
Discount offer is more popular compared to bogo offer, with bogo10 being the least desired offer to complete.<br>
Male, young and low-income customers have lowest completion rates. This may not be just because of money, for example for bogo sometimes you need to be more than one person to be able to complete the offer, however this may not be the case specifically for a young person.<br>
High-income people has the highest offer completion rate. Old and middle-aged groups have very similar pattern in viewing and completing an offer.<br>
On the other hand, based on the predictive modeling and using four classification model, we were able to predict if a received offer would be completed with 64% accuracy and F-score of 61% with Random Forest Classification.
